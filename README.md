> "Choreography is the term that presides over a class of ideas: an idea is perhaps in this case a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action. " at [Choreographic Objects by William Forsythe](http://www.williamforsythe.com/essay.html); more quotes from the same author:

> "Choreographies model uncertain outcomes";

> "Choreographies traject ideas into the action of perception";

> "Choreographies may also refuse to act";

> "Choreographies suspend certainty";

> "Choreographies valorize failure";
